        		<h1>Research</h1>
				<div class="blurb">
					<h2>Data science:</h2>
					I am particularly interested in investigating the integration of machine learning algorithms in resource-constrained devices and sensors.
					In the past, I has investigated analytical maturity of businesses to support knowledge discovery using data analytics, solutions for data mining model
					management for self-service knowledge discovery, and the use of ontologies for knowledge modeling in domains such as e-government and e-commerce.

					<h2>Emerging Technologies:</h2>
				My research in emerging technologies explore the use of low-power low-cost technologies in translational informatics, an interdisciplinary branch of
				the biomedical field targeting the translation of basic scientific findings from the laboratory to the treatment of diseases. I have published highly cited studies
				related to the adoption of new technologies (e.g., cloud computing, SaaS, and mobile banking) and technology diffusion in organizations.
    		</div><!-- /.blurb -->

					<h2>Social Computing:</h2>
				In social computing, my research is the confluence of data analytics and emerging technologies, and targets the development and evaluation of artifacts
				 to improve social well-being of populations in the area of public health and education.
